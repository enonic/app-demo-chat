# app-demo-chat

This Enonic XP app demonstrates the use of WebSockets through simple chat functionality.
The app lets you join a chat room, and all chat messages are translated to morse code server side.

When installed, the app creates an url mapping that makes the chat available at `<host>/morse-chat` on the site it's added to.
